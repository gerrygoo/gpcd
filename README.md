# gerardo's portable configuration dotfiles

# branches:
## neutral
this branch has all the work-specific stuff commented out, as opposed to removed.  
it is meant to be an in-between work and main.

## main
this branch doesn't include any work stuff. any device-specific branches can start off from and sync to main's HEAD.
changes in main's HEAD can be patched into neutral/work
